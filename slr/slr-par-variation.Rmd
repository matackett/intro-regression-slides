### Caution: Correlation $\neq$ Causation

- The regression model is **<u>not</u>** a statement of causality
  + The regression model provides a description of the averages of $Y$ for different values of $X$


- The regression model alone **<u>cannot</u>** prove causality. You need either
  - Randomized experiment
  - Observational study in which all relevant confounding variables are controlled for adequately
  
  
### Cats!

- When veterinarians prescribe heart medicine for cats, the dosage often needs to be calibrated to the weight of the heart.

- It is very difficult to measure the heart's weight, so veterinarians need a way to estimate it. 

- One way to estimate it is using a cat's body weight which is more feasible to obtain (though still difficult depending on the cat!). 

- **Goal**: Fit a regression model that describes the relationship between a cat's heart weight and body weight.

### The Data

We will use the **cats** dataset from the MASS package. It contains the following characteristics for 144 cats: 
- <font class = "vocab">`Sex`</font>: Male (M) or Female (F)
- <font class = "vocab">`Bwt`</font>: Body weight in kilograms (kg)
- <font class = "vocab">`Hwt`</font>: Heart weight in grams (g)

```{r}
cats %>% slice(1:10)
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r echo = F}
p1 <- ggplot(data = cats, aes(x = Bwt)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  labs(x = "Body Weight (kg)", 
       title = "Distribution of Body Weight")

p2 <- ggplot(data = cats, aes(x = Hwt)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Heart Weight (g)", 
       title = "Distribution of Heart Weight")

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = cats, aes(x = Sex)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label =..count..), vjust = 3, color = "white")
```


---

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r echo = F}
cats %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = cats, aes(x = Bwt, y = Hwt)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Body Weight (kg)",
       y = "Heart Weight (g)", 
       title = "Heart Weight vs. Body Weight")
```

### Predictions

### Predictions for New Observations 

- We can use the regression model to predict for a response at $x_0$

$$\hat{y} =  \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_0$$
<br> 

- Because the regression models produces the mean response for a given value of $x_0$, it will produce the same estimate whether we want to predict the mean response at $x_0$ or an individual response at $x_0$

### Predicting Mindy's heart weight

.pull-left[
My cat Mindy weighs about 3.18 kg (7 lbs). 

What is her predicted heart weight? 
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, out.height = '60%', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/05/mindy.JPG")
```
]

--


.alert[
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{hwt} &= -0.3567 + 4.0341 \times \color{red}{3.18} \\
&= 12.472 \text{ grams}
\end{align}
$$
]

### Uncertainty in predictions

- There is uncertainty in our predictions, so we need to calculate an a standard error (SE) to capture the uncertainty

- The SE is different depending on whether you are predicting an average value or an individual value

- SE is larger when predicting for an individual value than for an average value 

---

### Standard errors for predictions

.alert[
**Predicting the mean response**

$$SE(\hat{\mu}) = \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$
]
<br><br>

--

.alert[
**Predicting an individual response**

$$SE(\hat{y}) = \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x-\bar{x})^2}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}$$
]

---

### CI for predicted heart weight

- Calculate a 95% prediction interval for Mindy's predicted heart weight. 

```{r echo = F}
bwt_hwt_model <- lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)
```

```{r}
x0 <- data.frame(Bwt = c(3.18))
predict.lm(bwt_hwt_model, x0, interval = "prediction", #<<
           conf.level = 0.95) 
```

--


- Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the predicted mean heart weight for the subset of cats who weigh 3.18 kg. 

```{r}
x0 <- data.frame(Bwt = c(3.18))
predict.lm(bwt_hwt_model, x0, interval = "confidence", #<<
           conf.level = 0.95) 
```

## Cautions 

---

### Caution: Extrapolation 

- The regression is only useful for predictions for the response variable $y$ in the range of the predictor variable $x$ that was used to fit the regression 

- It is risky to predict far beyond that range of $x$, since you don't have data to tell whether or not the relationship continues to follow a straight line

### Caution: Extrapolation

.pull-left[
My cat Andy weighs about 8.60 kg (10 lbs). 

Should we use this regression model to predict his heart weight? 
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, out.height = '50%', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/05/andy.JPG")
```
]

--

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 2}
cats %>% summarise(min = min(Bwt), q1 = quantile(Bwt, 0.25),  median = median(Bwt),
                   q3 = quantile(Bwt, 0.75), max = max(Bwt)) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown")
```

The heaviest cat in this dataset weighs 3.9 kg (8.6 lbs). We should **<u>not</u>** use this model to predict Andy's heart weight, since that would be a case of <font class = "vocab">extrapolation</font>.
